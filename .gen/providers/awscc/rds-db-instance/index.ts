  *  If you do not specify a value for ``PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId``, then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your AWS account. Your AWS account has a different default KMS key for each AWS Region.
  *   *Update behavior:* Once Performance Insights is enabled with a KMS key, you cannot change to a different physical KMS key without replacing the DB instance. However, the following updates do not require replacement:
  *   +  Enabling or disabling Performance Insights using the ``EnablePerformanceInsights`` property
  *   +  Changing between different identifier formats (key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, alias name) of the same physical KMS key
  *   +  Removing the ``PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId`` property from your template
  *   
  *    *Drift behavior:* If you specify ``PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId`` while ``EnablePerformanceInsights`` is set to ``false``, CloudFormation will report drift. This occurs because the RDS API does not allow setting a KMS key when Performance Insights is disabled. CloudFormation ignores the ``PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId`` value during instance creation to avoid API errors, resulting in a mismatch between your template and the actual instance configuration.
  *  To avoid drift, omit both ``EnablePerformanceInsights`` and ``PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId`` during initial instance creation, then set both properties together when you're ready to enable Performance Insights.
